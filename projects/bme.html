            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project commenced because I participated in a pilot course in my University. This course was focused on ITM students developing projects and systems alongside BME students. The aim of this project was to develop a learning platform for BME students to study and practice developing software with a focus on scalability, maintainability and upgradability. For ITM students, the goal was to get hands-on experience developing programs for BME purposes. Also, to start learning how to develop CUDA kernels for computing optimization.

            <h2>System Design</h2>
            <p>
                The software follows a modular design. Each component is structured into separate files that handle specific responsibilities. Modularity allows a clear separation between the user interface, backend, utility functions and GPU optimization.

            <h2>GPU Acceleration in MATLAB</h2>
            <p>
                MATLAB's capabilities can be extended with GPU acceleration using NVIDIA graphics cards. This can be done through high-level functions with `gpuArray` or by integrating custom CUDA kernels via MEX interfaces for low-level control. In this project, we opted for the low-level approach with NVIDIA CUDA to maximize performance, which requires a CUDA-compatible GPU and the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit.

            <h2>CUDA Implementation for the Voltage Experiment</h2>
            <p>
                The GPU module was specifically developed for the Voltage experiment and is encapsulated in ‘voltage_kernel.cu’. To benchmark performance, we created a temporary backend to compare the execution time of the GPU-accelerated code against the CPU-based implementation. The CUDA code is structured as follows:
            </p>
            <h3>Device Functions</h3>
            <p>
                These functions are executed on the GPU and replace the standard MATLAB support functions, allowing the kernel to perform calculations independently.
            </p>

            </div>

            <h3>Kernel Code</h3>
            <p>
                The kernel is the core of the GPU code, replacing the main processing loop to enable parallel execution on the GPU.
            </p>

            </div>

            <h3>MEX Wrapper</h3>
            <p>
                The MEX wrapper integrates the CUDA code into a MATLAB-callable function. It manages memory allocation on the GPU, sets up the execution grid and block sizes, and handles data transfer between the GPU and the MATLAB environment.
