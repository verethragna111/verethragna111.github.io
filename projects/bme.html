        <h1>Hodgkin-Huxley model run in  MATLAB and CUDA</h1>
        <p>
            This project commenced because I participated in a pilot course in my University. 
            This course was focused on ITM students developing projects and systems alongside BME students. 
            The aim of this project was to develop a learning platform for BME students to study and practice developing software with a focus on scalability, maintainability and upgradability. 
            For ITM students, the goal was to get hands-on experience developing programs for BME purposes. Also, to start learning how to develop CUDA kernels for computing optimization.  
            
        </p>

        <h2>Design of the system</h2>
        <p>
            The software follows a modular design. Each component is structured into separate files that handle specific responsibilities. 
            Modularity allows a clear separation between the user interface, backend, utility functions and GPU optimization.

        <h2>GPU paralelization in MATLAB</h2>
        <p>
            MATLAB supports GPU acceleration using NVIDIA graphics cards. This can be achieved either through high-level parallelization using special data types like gpuArray, or through low-level GPU programming using custom CUDA kernels via MEX interfaces. In this software, we leverage low-level GPU parallelization using NVIDIA CUDA. This requires a CUDA compatible hardware and the installation of the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit [https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit]
        </p>

        <h2>Voltage Experiment, GPU paralelization with CUDA</h2>
        <p>
            We have made the GPU module for the Voltage experiment. This is called ‘voltage_kernel.cu’. To measure the performance of the code we have made a temporary backend module that uses both methods (GPU and CPU) and shows the running time.The structure of this cuda code is:
                Device functions: To substitute the support functions. These are here so that the Kernel can calculate them since it can not call for the Matlab functions declared in the ‘Support_Function’ Module.

            Kernel Code: This is the code that substitutes the for loop to execute it in the GPU through the use of CUDA.

        <p>
            Mex wrapper: This is the part of the code that wraps the CUDA code into a usable Matlab function. It calculates the initial variables and prepares the resource allocation for the code in the GPU (Block size, grid, etc..). It also handles the memory interaction between the GPU and the Matlab program.
